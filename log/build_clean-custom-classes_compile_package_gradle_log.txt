The input changes require a full rebuild for incremental task ':compile'.
Full recompilation is required because no incremental change information is available. This is usually caused by clean builds or changing compiler arguments.
Compiling with toolchain 'C:\Program Files\Eclipse Adoptium\jdk-11.0.16.101-hotspot'.
Compiling with JDK Java compiler API.
